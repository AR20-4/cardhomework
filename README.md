cpnt260-a2
By: Rachel Glasgow

I didn't name my repo cpnt260-a2 because I already created it with this name, and it's easier for me to keep things organized.

I attribute some of my code to a random code pen, I just looked up media cards and found something I liked for the mock up, I liked the drop shadow. 

On the MDN site I looked up a code for transform to add movement.
